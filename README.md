# NES' 6502 processor implementation in Go

This project started as an NES emulator which was going to be built in Go. Unfortunately I had to scrap that idea because I could not test the code I have written in Go since many programs which were supposed to help me in testing my 6502 processor are not supported for Go (support is for C and C++). Due to this reason, this project will be haulted here but I did learn a lot from basic computer architecture to many concepts around how a processor actually works.

> Not all operations are written in this code. Only the ones which are included in instructions of NES are implemented.
