# NES emulator in Golang

This project started as an NES emulator which was going to be built in Go. I was a beginner when I started this and couldn't understand/finish it properly and lost all my hopes. I restarted working on this in C as I have gained more experience with working on these things since I made Chip-8 emulator in Go. I will be continuing any progress there on my "NES emulator in C" repository.
